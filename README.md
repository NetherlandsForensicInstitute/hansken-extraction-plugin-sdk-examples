# Extraction Plugin SDK Examples

This repository contains example setup and implementations of extraction plugins for Hansken. We have multiple
implementations of the API, for different languages. These are contained in the directories named as that language.
There you can find README files specific to that implementation. Or use the links below:

* [Ja va Extraction Plugins](java/README.md)

* [Python Extraction Plugins](python/README.md)

If you just want to create a fresh Python plugin from scratch, you can use the [extraction plugin template](https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/hansken-extraction-plugin-template-python).

## Extraction Plugin SDK

The Extraction Plugin Software Development Kit can be used to develop an extraction plugin that can be run during the
extraction process. Check the 
[Extraction Plugins SDK Documentation](https://netherlandsforensicinstitute.github.io/hansken-extraction-plugin-sdk-documentation/latest/) 
for everything you need to know on how to write, test and use Extraction Plugins.
